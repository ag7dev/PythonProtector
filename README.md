## Features ‚ö°

### **Anti-Virtualization** üö´üñ•Ô∏è

- **Triage Detection**: Identifies if your application is being analyzed in a triage environment.  
- **Monitor Metrics**: Tracks system metrics to spot abnormal behavior typically associated with virtual environments.  
- **VirtualBox Detection**: Detects if Oracle's VirtualBox is running, preventing execution in virtualized setups.  
- **VMware Detection**: Identifies the presence of VMware, another popular virtualization platform.  
- **KVM Check**: Detects Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisors to prevent virtualized execution.  
- **Username Validation**: Ensures that the current user is not a default username typically used by virtual machines.  
- **Recent User Activity Check**: Verifies user activity by checking file interactions; exits if fewer than 20 files are found.  
- **USB Mount Detection**: Checks for previously plugged USB devices, a common sign of virtual machine images.  
- **QEMU Detection**: Identifies the use of QEMU virtualization, helping you detect environments built with QEMU.  
- **Parallels Check**: Detects if Parallels virtualization software is in use.  
- **VM Artifacts Search**: Looks for common artifacts that suggest a virtual machine environment, helping to confirm if the app is running in a VM.

### **Anti-Debugging** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- **Debugger Detection**: Uses the `IsDebuggerPresent` API to check if a debugger is attached to your process.  
- **Remote Debugger Detection**: Identifies if a remote debugger is trying to access your application.  
- **System Uptime Check**: Monitors system uptime to detect if the system has been recently restarted, a common sign of debugging attempts.  
- **Blacklisted Window Names**: Checks if the process is running under a suspicious or blacklisted window name commonly associated with debuggers.  
- **Suspicious Process Detection**: Lists and checks running processes, terminating known malicious or debugging-related processes.  
- **Parent Process Check**: Examines if the parent process is attempting to debug the current process, preventing unauthorized debugging.  
- **Malicious Process Termination**: Actively kills processes that are known to be harmful or associated with reverse engineering tools.  
- **Internet Connectivity Check**: Ensures that an internet connection is available, which can be a sign of external debugger communication.

### **Process Management** ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Critical Process Setup**: Sets your process as critical, making it harder for attackers to kill or tamper with.
