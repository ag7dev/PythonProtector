# IMPORTANT NOTICE:
# The KillBadProcesses function attempts to terminate a list of specified processes related to debugging or reverse engineering tools.
# This could be used as part of anti-debugging or anti-tampering measures in software or systems.
#
# Key points to consider:
# - The function uses the `taskkill` command to forcefully terminate processes.
# - It includes error handling to log if a process cannot be terminated or if an unexpected error occurs.
# - This method targets known process names commonly associated with debugging tools, malware analysis, and system monitoring.
#
# Use this function responsibly:
# - Killing processes without user consent or for malicious purposes is unethical and could cause system instability or loss of data.
# - Use only in appropriate and ethical contexts, such as for legitimate security or administrative tasks.
